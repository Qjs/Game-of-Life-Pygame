# Game of Life Pygame

Game of Life made in Pygame, in memory of Dr. John Conway

## Rules of the game:

[Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life), if you are not familiar, is a zero-player cellular automaton game on a 2D array that can make some fascinating evolutions given the right input instruction.

The Rules are very simple:
1. Any live cell with less than two live neighbors dies.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives.
3. Any live cell with greater than three live neighbors dies.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes live.


## Controls:

- Right Click: Make a cell alive
- Left Click: Make a cell dead
- Space: Start and Pause updating
- R: reset screen
